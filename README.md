What it Contains

🌟 Monitor: This Component will give the constant monitoring of the video which is going to be captured by the camera.

🌟 Identify: We are currently working on this module of identification to differentiate between the known people and unknown people by just taking out their names and images and then if any other person finds them then it will show the unknown person entered in the ring of our camera.
